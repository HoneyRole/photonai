<h1>Reasons to Use PHOTONAI</h1>
<ul class="uk-list">
<li>It allows researchers to build, optimize and evaluate machine learning pipelines with 
    few lines of code</li>
<li>It automates the training, optimization and test workflow according to user-defined parameters. </li>
<li>It offers convenient access to established machine learning toolboxes such as sklearn</li>
<li>It is especially well-suited for researchers with little programming experience. </li>
<li>Users can select and change hyperparameter optimization strategies by keywords</li>
<li> It is built on clean interfaces and therefore fully customizable.</li>
<li>It is easily extendable with custom algorithms, e.g. for handling biomedical data modalities.</li>
<li>It acts as a unifying framework to help researchers share and reuse code across projects. </li>
<li>It offers both simple and parallel pipeline streams for comparing algorithms, combining features and building ensembles</li>
<li>It extends existing pipeline implementations to enable the developer, e.g. to change the dataset (data augmentation) 
    within the training and testing cross validation splits at runtime.</li>
<li>It enables rapid prototyping in contexts which require iterative evaluation of novel machine learning models.</li>
<li>and many others...</li>
